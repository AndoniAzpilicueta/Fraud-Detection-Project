Anomaly detection is the identification of rare events, items, or observations which are suspicious because they differ significantly from standard behaviors or patterns. Anomalies in data are also called standard deviations, outliers, noise, novelties, and exceptions.
For example, credit/debit card fraud detection, as a use case of anomaly detection, is the process of checking whether the incoming transaction request fits well with the user's previous profile and behavior or not
